Hi, I am harshit, want to let you know about websites which came along the way in completing the Byte Cybersec Task.	The main and initial was to find a website and correct the QR code as provided in the task.
Which Later by , https://merri.cx/qrazybox/ , I improved the qr code
And by decoding with the help of same website I got this â€“ 
https://byte-cybersec-ps.vercel.app/
After figuring out answer which is robots.txt , I opened the next website.
Using this website next, I got the website for flag (encrypted flag), 
After understanding and solving this I got the code which gave original flag i.e. Flag{3xpl0itin1g_8oundar1es_w1th_8yte}
so this is all about my cyber security task.
